# Version Control

This document outlines the version control practices used in the CapyMOA project.

## Commit Messages

**tldr; Run `python -m invoke commit` (or `invoke commit`, `python -m commitizen commit`) to commit changes.** (Requires that you've [installed the optional development dependencies](../installation.md).)

CapyMOA uses conventional commit messages to streamline the release process.

> "The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of
> commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit
> commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.
> This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes,
> and breaking changes made in commit messages." -- [conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)

Conventional commits are structured as follows:

    <type>[optional scope]: <description>

or

    <type>[optional scope]: <description>

    [optional body]

    [optional footer(s)]

Here are some basic examples:

    docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG


    feat(lang): add Polish language

Where:

* `<type>` is one of
  * `feat`: New feature. **Will increment the MINOR version number.**
  * `fix`: Bug fix. **Will increment the patch version number.**
  * `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
  * `chore`: Repetitive tasks such as updating dependencies
  * `ci`: Changes to continuous integration configuration files and scripts
  * `docs`: Documentation changes
  * `perf`: Performance improvement
  * `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  * `revert`: Revert a previous commit
  * `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  * `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* `[optional scope]` is a module or component affected by the commit. A top level python module is a good example of a scope:
  * `classifier`
  * `datasets`
  * `stream`
  * etc.

  Its okay to leave out the scope if its not obvious or not applicable.

* `<description>` This should be a short, concise lowercase description of the change in the imperative mood (e.g. "add ...", "change ...", "fix", "remove...").

## Breaking Changes

If the API changes in a way that is not backwards-compatible, the commit message
should include a `!` after the type/scope, e.g. `feat(classifiers)!: ...`.

You can and probably should include more information in the body and footer of
the commit message to explain the breaking change. See [conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for more information.

    chore!: drop support for python 3.9

    BREAKING CHANGE: use Python features only available in 3.10
