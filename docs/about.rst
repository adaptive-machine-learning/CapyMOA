            Heitor Murilo Gomes is currently a senior lecturer at Victoria
            University of Wellington (VuW) in New Zealand. Previously, he served
            as co-director of the AI Institute at the University of Waikato
            (UoW), where he supervised PhD students and research assistants.
            From 2020 to 2022, he taught the "Data Stream Mining" course at UoW.
            His primary research focuses on applying machine learning to data
            streams, encompassing tasks such as ensemble learning,
            semi-supervised learning, drift detection and recovery, and the
            intersection of online continual learning with data streams. Heitor
            has also made significant contributions to several open-source
            projects specializing in online and stream learning, notably MOA
            (Massive Online Analysis), for over a decade.

            I am a research scientist and PhD student in the field of machine
            learning and data mining at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. I
            focus on learning from sequential data, specifically the
            intersection between data stream mining and decision making under
            uncertainty. I am interested in everything that concerns data
            streams and online learning and I have mainly worked on change
            detection, incremental decision trees and multi-armed bandits.
